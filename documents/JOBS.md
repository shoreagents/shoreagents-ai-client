## Sample Data Structure

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields
- `jobTitle`: Must not be empty
- `location`: Must not be empty  
- `jobDescription`: Must not be empty

### Data Constraints
- `salaryMin` & `salaryMax`: Positive numbers only
- `applicationDeadline`: Must be future date
- Array fields: Empty strings are filtered out before saving
- `experienceLevel`: Must be one of the defined enum values
- `workArrangement`: Must be one of the defined enum values

## Special Handling

### "Others" Selection
When user selects "Others" from Industry or Department dropdown:
1. A text input field appears
2. User enters custom value
3. System stores the custom text instead of "Others"
4. Custom text is validated to ensure it's not empty

### Array Fields Processing
Before saving to database:
- Remove empty strings from arrays
- Trim whitespace from each array item
- Ensure arrays don't contain only empty values

## Notes for Development

1. **Currency & Salary**: All salaries are in PHP and monthly basis
2. **Work Type**: System only supports full-time positions  
3. **Company Context**: `companyId` should be retrieved from user session
4. **Unique IDs**: `jobId` format: "JOB-" + timestamp
5. **Status Management**: Jobs start as "active", can be changed to "inactive", "closed", etc.
6. **Counters**: `views` and `applicants` should be incremented through separate API endpoints
